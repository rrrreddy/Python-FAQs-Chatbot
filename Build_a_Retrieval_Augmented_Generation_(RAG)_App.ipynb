        "## Building a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) App\n",
        "\n",
        "### Introduction to RAG\n",
        "**Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a powerful technique for building sophisticated question-answering (Q&A) applications using Large Language Models (LLMs). These applications can answer questions about specific source information by augmenting the knowledge of LLMs with additional, relevant data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Purpose of RAG\n",
        "- **Enhancing LLMs**: LLMs are trained on public data up to a specific cutoff date. RAG enables the integration of private or more recent data, improving the model's ability to reason about this new information.\n",
        "- **Application**: Used to create Q&A chatbots that can handle queries about specific data sources.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Components of a RAG Application\n",
        "1. **Indexing**\n",
        "   - **Loading Data**: Ingesting data from a source using DocumentLoaders.\n",
        "   - **Splitting Text**: Breaking large documents into smaller chunks using text splitters. This makes the data easier to index and fit within the model's context window.\n",
        "   - **Storing Data**: Indexing and storing the text chunks using a VectorStore and an Embeddings model.\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **Retrieval and Generation**\n",
        "   - **Retrieving Data**: Using a Retriever to fetch relevant data chunks based on the user’s query.\n",
        "   - **Generating Answers**: Using a ChatModel or LLM to produce an answer by combining the user’s question with the retrieved data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Workflow of a RAG Application\n",
        "1. **Indexing Phase**\n",
        "   - **Load**: Import data using DocumentLoaders.\n",
        "   - **Split**: Use text splitters to divide large documents into manageable chunks.\n",
        "   - **Store**: Index and store these chunks in a VectorStore for efficient retrieval.\n",
        "   - **Diagram**: Visual representation of the indexing process shows data loading, splitting, and storing in an indexed format.\n",

        "\n",
        "2. **Retrieval and Generation Phase**\n",
        "   - **Retrieve**: Upon receiving a user query, the system retrieves the most relevant chunks of data from the VectorStore.\n",
        "   - **Generate**: The retrieved data, combined with the user’s query, is used by the LLM to generate a coherent and relevant answer.\n",
        "\n",
        "   ![Alt Text](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/assets/images/rag_retrieval_generation-1046a4668d6bb08786ef73c56d4f228a.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Tools and Technologies\n",
        "- **LangChain**: Provides components to build Q&A applications and RAG systems.\n",
        "- **DocumentLoaders**: For loading data into the system.\n",
        "- **Text Splitters**: For breaking down documents into smaller chunks.\n",
        "- **VectorStore**: For storing and indexing data chunks.\n",
        "- **Embeddings Model**: To transform data chunks into searchable vector representations.\n",
        "- **Retriever**: To fetch relevant data chunks based on user queries.\n",
        "- **ChatModel/LLM**: To generate answers using the retrieved data and user query.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example Application Workflow\n",
        "1. **Data Ingestion**: Load a large text document using DocumentLoaders.\n",
        "2. **Data Preparation**: Split the document into smaller, manageable chunks with text splitters.\n",
        "3. **Data Indexing**: Store these chunks in a VectorStore, indexed using an Embeddings model.\n",
        "4. **Query Processing**:\n",
        "   - When a user submits a query, the Retriever searches the VectorStore for relevant data chunks.\n",
        "   - The retrieved data is combined with the user’s query and fed into a ChatModel or LLM.\n",
        "   - The model generates and returns a relevant answer to the user.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Advanced Techniques and Resources\n",
        "- **LangSmith**: A tool to trace and understand the application, becoming more valuable as the application's complexity increases.\n",
        "- **RAG over Structured Data**: For those interested in applying RAG to structured data like SQL databases, that can also possible using LangChain.\n",

It\\nincorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high level dynamic data\\ntypes, and classes.  It supports multiple programming paradigms beyond\\nobject-oriented programming, such as procedural and functional programming.\\nPython combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. It has interfaces to\\nmany system calls and libraries, as well as to various window systems, and is\\nextensible in C or C++.  It is also usable as an extension language for\\napplications that need a programmable interface. Finally, Python is portable:\\nit runs on many Unix variants including Linux and macOS, and on Windows.\\nTo find out more, start with The Python Tutorial.  The Beginner’s Guide to\\nPython links to other\\nintroductory tutorials and resources for learning Python.\\n\\n\\nWhat is the Python Software Foundation?¶\\nThe Python Software Foundation is an independent non-profit organization that\\nholds the copyright on Python versions 2.1 and newer.  The PSF’s mission is to\\nadvance open source technology related to the Python programming language and to\\npublicize the use of Python.  The PSF’s home page is at\\nhttps://www.python.org/psf/.\\nDonations to the PSF are tax-exempt in the US.  If you use Python and find it\\nhelpful, please contribute via the PSF donation page.\\n\\n\\nAre there copyright restrictions on the use of Python?¶\\nYou can do anything you want with the source, as long as you leave the\\ncopyrights in and display those copyrights in any documentation about Python\\nthat you produce.  If you honor the copyright rules, it’s OK to use Python for\\ncommercial use, to sell copies of Python in source or binary form (modified or\\nunmodified), or to sell products that incorporate Python in some form.  We would\\nstill like to know about all commercial use of Python, of course.\\nSee the license page to find further\\nexplanations and the full text of the PSF License.\\nThe Python logo is trademarked, and in certain cases permission is required to\\nuse it.  Consult the Trademark Usage Policy for more information.\\n\\n\\nWhy was Python created in the first place?¶\\nHere’s a very brief summary of what started it all, written by Guido van\\nRossum:\\n\\nI had extensive experience with implementing an interpreted language in the\\nABC group at CWI, and from working with this group I had learned a lot about\\nlanguage design.  This is the origin of many Python features, including the\\nuse of indentation for statement grouping and the inclusion of\\nvery-high-level data types (although the details are all different in\\nPython).\\nI had a number of gripes about the ABC language, but also liked many of its\\nfeatures.  It was impossible to extend the ABC language (or its\\nimplementation) to remedy my complaints – in fact its lack of extensibility\\nwas one of its biggest problems.  I had some experience with using Modula-2+\\nand talked with the designers of Modula-3 and read the Modula-3 report.\\nModula-3 is the origin of the syntax and semantics used for exceptions, and\\nsome other Python features.\\nI was working in the Amoeba distributed operating system group at CWI.  We\\nneeded a better way to do system administration than by writing either C\\nprograms or Bourne shell scripts, since Amoeba had its own system call\\ninterface which wasn’t easily accessible from the Bourne shell.  My\\nexperience with error handling in Amoeba made me acutely aware of the\\nimportance of exceptions as a programming language feature.\\nIt occurred to me that a scripting language with a syntax like ABC but with\\naccess to the Amoeba system calls would fill the need.  I realized that it\\nwould be foolish to write an Amoeba-specific language, so I decided that I\\nneeded a language that was generally extensible.\\nDuring the 1989 Christmas holidays, I had a lot of time on my hand, so I\\ndecided to give it a try.  During the next year, while still mostly working\\non it in my own time, Python was used in the Amoeba project with increasing\\nsuccess, and the feedback from colleagues made me add many early\\nimprovements.\\nIn February 1991, after just over a year of development, I decided to post to\\nUSENET.  The rest is in the Misc/HISTORY file.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is Python good for?¶\\nPython is a high-level general-purpose programming language that can be applied\\nto many different classes of problems.\\nThe language comes with a large standard library that covers areas such as\\nstring processing (regular expressions, Unicode, calculating differences between\\nfiles), internet protocols (HTTP, FTP, SMTP, XML-RPC, POP, IMAP),\\nsoftware engineering (unit testing, logging, profiling, parsing\\nPython code), and operating system interfaces (system calls, filesystems, TCP/IP\\nsockets).  Look at the table of contents for The Python Standard Library to get an idea\\nof what’s available.  A wide variety of third-party extensions are also\\navailable.  Consult the Python Package Index to\\nfind packages of interest to you.\\n\\n\\nHow does the Python version numbering scheme work?¶\\nPython versions are numbered “A.B.C” or “A.B”:\\n\\nA is the major version number – it is only incremented for really major\\nchanges in the language.\\nB is the minor version number – it is incremented for less earth-shattering\\nchanges.\\nC is the micro version number – it is incremented for each bugfix release.\\n\\nNot all releases are bugfix releases.  In the run-up to a new feature release, a\\nseries of development releases are made, denoted as alpha, beta, or release\\ncandidate.  Alphas are early releases in which interfaces aren’t yet finalized;\\nit’s not unexpected to see an interface change between two alpha releases.\\nBetas are more stable, preserving existing interfaces but possibly adding new\\nmodules, and release candidates are frozen, making no changes except as needed\\nto fix critical bugs.\\nAlpha, beta and release candidate versions have an additional suffix:\\n\\nThe suffix for an alpha version is “aN” for some small number N.\\nThe suffix for a beta version is “bN” for some small number N.\\nThe suffix for a release candidate version is “rcN” for some small number N.\\n\\nIn other words, all versions labeled 2.0aN precede the versions labeled\\n2.0bN, which precede versions labeled 2.0rcN, and those precede 2.0.\\nYou may also find version numbers with a “+” suffix, e.g. “2.2+”.  These are\\nunreleased versions, built directly from the CPython development repository.  In\\npractice, after a final minor release is made, the version is incremented to the\\nnext minor version, which becomes the “a0” version, e.g. “2.4a0”.\\nSee the Developer’s Guide\\nfor more information about the development cycle, and\\nPEP 387 to learn more about Python’s backward compatibility policy.  See also\\nthe documentation for sys.version, sys.hexversion, and\\nsys.version_info.\\n\\n\\nHow do I obtain a copy of the Python source?¶\\nThe latest Python source distribution is always available from python.org, at\\nhttps://www.python.org/downloads/.  The latest development sources can be obtained\\nat https://github.com/python/cpython/.\\nThe source distribution is a gzipped tar file containing the complete C source,\\nSphinx-formatted documentation, Python library modules, example programs, and\\nseveral useful pieces of freely distributable software.  The source will compile\\nand run out of the box on most UNIX platforms.\\nConsult the Getting Started section of the Python Developer’s Guide for more\\ninformation on getting the source code and compiling it.\\n\\n\\nHow do I get documentation on Python?¶\\nThe standard documentation for the current stable version of Python is available\\nat https://docs.python.org/3/.  PDF, plain text, and downloadable HTML versions are\\nalso available at https://docs.python.org/3/download.html.\\nThe documentation is written in reStructuredText and processed by the Sphinx\\ndocumentation tool.  The reStructuredText source for\\nthe documentation is part of the Python source distribution.\\n\\n\\nI’ve never programmed before. Is there a Python tutorial?¶\\nThere are numerous tutorials and books available.  The standard documentation\\nincludes The Python Tutorial.\\nConsult the Beginner’s Guide to\\nfind information for beginning Python programmers, including lists of tutorials.\\n\\n\\nIs there a newsgroup or mailing list devoted to Python?¶\\nThere is a newsgroup, comp.lang.python, and a mailing list,\\npython-list.  The\\nnewsgroup and mailing list are gatewayed into each other – if you can read news\\nit’s unnecessary to subscribe to the mailing list.\\ncomp.lang.python is high-traffic, receiving hundreds of postings\\nevery day, and Usenet readers are often more able to cope with this volume.\\nAnnouncements of new software releases and events can be found in\\ncomp.lang.python.announce, a low-traffic moderated list that receives about five\\npostings per day.  It’s available as the python-announce mailing list.\\nMore info about other mailing lists and newsgroups\\ncan be found at https://www.python.org/community/lists/.\\n\\n\\nHow do I get a beta test version of Python?¶\\nAlpha and beta releases are available from https://www.python.org/downloads/.  All\\nreleases are announced on the comp.lang.python and comp.lang.python.announce\\nnewsgroups and on the Python home page at https://www.python.org/; an RSS feed of\\nnews is available.\\nYou can also access the development version of Python through Git.  See\\nThe Python Developer’s Guide for details.\\n\\n\\nHow do I submit bug reports and patches for Python?¶\\nTo report a bug or submit a patch, use the issue tracker at\\nhttps://github.com/python/cpython/issues.\\nFor more information on how Python is developed, consult the Python Developer’s\\nGuide.\\n\\n\\nAre there any published articles about Python that I can reference?¶\\nIt’s probably best to cite your favorite book about Python.\\nThe very first article about Python was\\nwritten in 1991 and is now quite outdated.\\n\\nGuido van Rossum and Jelke de Boer, “Interactively Testing Remote Servers\\nUsing the Python Programming Language”, CWI Quarterly, Volume 4, Issue 4\\n(December 1991), Amsterdam, pp 283–303.\\n\\n\\n\\nAre there any books on Python?¶\\nYes, there are many, and more are being published.  See the python.org wiki at\\nhttps://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonBooks for a list.\\nYou can also search online bookstores for “Python” and filter out the Monty\\nPython references; or perhaps search for “Python” and “language”.\\n\\n\\nWhere in the world is www.python.org located?¶\\nThe Python project’s infrastructure is located all over the world and is managed\\nby the Python Infrastructure Team. Details here.\\n\\n\\nWhy is it called Python?¶\\nWhen he began implementing Python, Guido van Rossum was also reading the\\npublished scripts from “Monty Python’s Flying Circus”, a BBC comedy series from the 1970s.  Van Rossum\\nthought he needed a name that was short, unique, and slightly mysterious, so he\\ndecided to call the language Python.\\n\\n\\nDo I have to like “Monty Python’s Flying Circus”?¶\\nNo, but it helps.  :)\\n\\n\\n\\nPython in the real world¶\\n\\nHow stable is Python?¶\\nVery stable.  New, stable releases have been coming out roughly every 6 to 18\\nmonths since 1991, and this seems likely to continue.  As of version 3.9,\\nPython will have a new feature release every 12 months (PEP 602).\\nThe developers issue bugfix releases of older versions, so the stability of\\nexisting releases gradually improves.  Bugfix releases, indicated by a third\\ncomponent of the version number (e.g. 3.5.3, 3.6.2), are managed for stability;\\nonly fixes for known problems are included in a bugfix release, and it’s\\nguaranteed that interfaces will remain the same throughout a series of bugfix\\nreleases.\\nThe latest stable releases can always be found on the Python download page.  There are two production-ready versions\\nof Python: 2.x and 3.x. The recommended version is 3.x, which is supported by\\nmost widely used libraries.  Although 2.x is still widely used, it is not\\nmaintained anymore.\\n\\n\\nHow many people are using Python?¶\\nThere are probably millions of users, though it’s difficult to obtain an exact\\ncount.\\nPython is available for free download, so there are no sales figures, and it’s\\navailable from many different sites and packaged with many Linux distributions,\\nso download statistics don’t tell the whole story either.\\nThe comp.lang.python newsgroup is very active, but not all Python users post to\\nthe group or even read it.\\n\\n\\nHave any significant projects been done in Python?¶\\nSee https://www.python.org/about/success for a list of projects that use Python.\\nConsulting the proceedings for past Python conferences will reveal contributions from many\\ndifferent companies and organizations.\\nHigh-profile Python projects include the Mailman mailing list manager and the Zope application server.  Several Linux distributions, most notably Red Hat, have written part or all of their installer and\\nsystem administration software in Python.  Companies that use Python internally\\ninclude Google, Yahoo, and Lucasfilm Ltd.\\n\\n\\nWhat new developments are expected for Python in the future?¶\\nSee https://peps.python.org/ for the Python Enhancement Proposals\\n(PEPs). PEPs are design documents describing a suggested new feature for Python,\\nproviding a concise technical specification and a rationale.  Look for a PEP\\ntitled “Python X.Y Release Schedule”, where X.Y is a version that hasn’t been\\npublicly released yet.\\nNew development is discussed on the python-dev mailing list.\\n\\n\\nIs it reasonable to propose incompatible changes to Python?¶\\nIn general, no.  There are already millions of lines of Python code around the\\nworld, so any change in the language that invalidates more than a very small\\nfraction of existing programs has to be frowned upon.  Even if you can provide a\\nconversion program, there’s still the problem of updating all documentation;\\nmany books have been written about Python, and we don’t want to invalidate them\\nall at a single stroke.\\nProviding a gradual upgrade path is necessary if a feature has to be changed.\\nPEP 5 describes the procedure followed for introducing backward-incompatible\\nchanges while minimizing disruption for users.\\n\\n\\nIs Python a good language for beginning programmers?¶\\nYes.\\nIt is still common to start students with a procedural and statically typed\\nlanguage such as Pascal, C, or a subset of C++ or Java.  Students may be better\\nserved by learning Python as their first language.  Python has a very simple and\\nconsistent syntax and a large standard library and, most importantly, using\\nPython in a beginning programming course lets students concentrate on important\\nprogramming skills such as problem decomposition and data type design.  With\\nPython, students can be quickly introduced to basic concepts such as loops and\\nprocedures.  They can probably even work with user-defined objects in their very\\nfirst course.\\nFor a student who has never programmed before, using a statically typed language\\nseems unnatural.  It presents additional complexity that the student must master\\nand slows the pace of the course.  The students are trying to learn to think\\nlike a computer, decompose problems, design consistent interfaces, and\\nencapsulate data.  While learning to use a statically typed language is\\nimportant in the long term, it is not necessarily the best topic to address in\\nthe students’ first programming course.\\nMany other aspects of Python make it a good first language.  Like Java, Python\\nhas a large standard library so that students can be assigned programming\\nprojects very early in the course that do something.  Assignments aren’t\\nrestricted to the standard four-function calculator and check balancing\\nprograms.  By using the standard library, students can gain the satisfaction of\\nworking on realistic applications as they learn the fundamentals of programming.\\nUsing the standard library also teaches students about code reuse.  Third-party\\nmodules such as PyGame are also helpful in extending the students’ reach.\\nPython’s interactive interpreter enables students to test language features\\nwhile they’re programming.  They can keep a window with the interpreter running\\nwhile they enter their program’s source in another window.  If they can’t\\nremember the methods for a list, they can do something like this:\\n>>> L = []\\n>>> dir(L) \\n['__add__', '__class__', '__contains__', '__delattr__', '__delitem__',\\n'__dir__', '__doc__', '__eq__', '__format__', '__ge__',\\n'__getattribute__', '__getitem__', '__gt__', '__hash__', '__iadd__',\\n'__imul__', '__init__', '__iter__', '__le__', '__len__', '__lt__',\\n'__mul__', '__ne__', '__new__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__',\\n'__repr__', '__reversed__', '__rmul__', '__setattr__', '__setitem__',\\n'__sizeof__', '__str__', '__subclasshook__', 'append', 'clear',\\n'copy', 'count', 'extend', 'index', 'insert', 'pop', 'remove',\\n'reverse', 'sort']\\n>>> [d for d in dir(L) if '__' not in d]\\n['append', 'clear', 'copy', 'count', 'extend', 'index', 'insert', 'pop', 'remove', 'reverse', 'sort']\\n\\n>>> help(L.append)\\nHelp on built-in function append:\\n\\nappend(...)\\n    L.append(object) -> None -- append object to end\\n\\n>>> L.append(1)\\n>>> L\\n[1]\\n\\n\\nWith the interpreter, documentation is never far from the student as they are\\nprogramming.\\nThere are also good IDEs for Python.  IDLE is a cross-platform IDE for Python\\nthat is written in Python using Tkinter.\\nEmacs users will be happy to know that there is a very good Python mode for\\nEmacs.  All of these programming environments provide syntax highlighting,\\nauto-indenting, and access to the interactive interpreter while coding.  Consult\\nthe Python wiki for a full list\\nof Python editing environments.\\nIf you want to discuss Python’s use in education, you may be interested in\\njoining the edu-sig mailing list.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\""
